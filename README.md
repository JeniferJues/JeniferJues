Hi Im Jenifer 

I had experience in programming language such as Python, R Programming, HiveQL and Octave Script (MATLAB).

I am intrigued by the idea of utilizing data to uncover hidden patterns and trends to solve real-world problems
by applying data science knowledge and skills to provide novel solutions to complex problems.

I have passion in continuous learning for the advancement of the field to expand knowledge and enhance skills.
