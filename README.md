Hi Im Jenifer 

Currently, I'm pursuing my study in Master of Data Science.
I am intrigued by the idea of utilizing data to uncover hidden patterns and trends to solve real-world problems
by applying data science knowledge and skills to provide novel solutions to complex problems. FROM DATA to TADA !!!
I have passion in continuous learning of the advancement in the field to expand knowledge and enhance skills.
I had experience in programming language such as Python, R Programming, HiveQL and Octave Script (MATLAB).
Here, I shared a few of my course projects that I did myself and with my teammates.
Looking forward to engaging or collaborating with other data science enthusiats to broaden my knowledges and elevating my skills to new heights.
